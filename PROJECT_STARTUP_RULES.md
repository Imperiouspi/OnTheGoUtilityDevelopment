# Project Startup Rules

Rules for Claude Code to follow when starting a new project in this repository.

## 1. Project Structure

Each project must live in its own individual top-level folder within the repository root. Do not nest projects inside other projects. The folder name should be a short, descriptive kebab-case name (e.g., `todo-cli`, `file-organizer`).
