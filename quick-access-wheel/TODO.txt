- centre the settings button icon
- Use modern styling and potential for future animations
- Make scaling consistent between resolutions/scaling (and maybe this will fix cutoff bug)
- Auto use program icon for launch-a-program action.
- Select colours dialog should never use the current highlight colour for any ui - why does it, for the buttons?
- Add the ability in settings to create a new layer For any program currently active on screen
- Switch keystroke action from "press keys" to "select modifiers + type key into box". Have a "?" button so it's clear what to call special keys e.g. space.
- Add a "reload manual config changes" button to settings, just in case the user changed the config in a text editor
- Create an exe that can run in the background so I don't have to launch the python file every time.
