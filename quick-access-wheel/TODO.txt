- Left click to execute faster, right clickt to edit config
- Auto use program icon for launch-a-program action.
- Switch keystroke action from "press keys" to "select modifiers + type key into box". Have a "?" button so it's clear what to call special keys e.g. space.
- Add a "reload manual config changes" button to settings, just in case the user changed the config in a text editor
- If a folder is removed, ask if remove from config. If create a new folder, optionally restore from saved.
- Create templates for programs: microsoft office (onenote, excel, word, ppt), sublime text to open with file, and explorer to open to a path.
- If a folder opens up to another folder, automatically continue to that folder without having to return to the centre.

- Add the ability in settings to create a new layer For any program currently active on screen
- centre the settings button icon
- Use modern styling and potential for future animations
- Make scaling consistent between resolutions/scaling (and maybe this will fix cutoff bug)
- Select colours dialog should never use the current highlight colour for any ui - why does it, for the buttons?
- Create an exe that can run in the background so I don't have to launch the python file every time.
- Open new branch - test opening folder around mouse instead of around original location.
